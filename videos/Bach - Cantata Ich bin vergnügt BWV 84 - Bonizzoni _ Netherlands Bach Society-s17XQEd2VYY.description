In this solo cantata, 'Ich bin vergnügt mit meinem Glücke' BWV 84, performed here by the Netherlands Bach Society conducted by Fabio Bonizzoni, the oboe and soprano express their joy. It is one of the few pieces referred to by Bach himself as a ‘cantata’. The text originates from one of the collections by Bach’s regular lyricist, Christian Friedrich Henrici, who wrote under the pseudonym of Picander.
