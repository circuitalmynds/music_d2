There were so many sounds you could dance to and it all rose to a fevered pitch in the summer of 1979. Pop, disco, R&B, rock and New Wave seemed to have so much more importance on radio, but the reality was that vinyl sales hit an all time low during this time. Why? Well, after the juggernaut success of "Saturday Night Fever", many vinyl pressers stopped producing anything else but that soundtrack in order to meet demand. This would lead to depleted stocks of other popular recording until they could be reprinted and sent to retailers. Not sure of the real reason, I mean with disco so popular and the birth of the 12", how could that be? I will figure it out someday. Out of the blue comes this elecronically charged tune that extolled the virtues of pop music with a new wave attitude by an artist with a single letter as a name, M. M was English musician Robin Scott who born April 1, 1947, He found he had a talent for writing and performing his music in the late 60's sharing the bill with David Bowie in an early incarnation. He expanded in to multimedia projects in 1970, then worked with Terry Britten (Tina Turner). He worked with several bands and then took to producing punk rock recordings by Adam & The Ants among others on his own Do It Records. On his own, be started on songs that would eventually comprise his biggest seller ever. Setting up shop in Montreux, Switzerland he began recording. One song he knew could be a hit was "Pop Muzik" and the song was initially recorded in R&B and funk styles before a friend of Scott suggested using synthesisers. Scott has said "I was looking to make a fusion of various styles which somehow would summarise the last 25 years of pop music. It was a deliberate point I was trying to make. Whereas rock and roll had created a generation gap, disco was bringing people together on an enormous scale. That's why I really wanted to make a simple, bland statement, which was, 'All we're talking about basically (is) pop music.'" He could have never guessed how completely he would succeed.
